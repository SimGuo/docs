For C++

Herein, The interfacing of Shogun's Machine Learning Toolbox with OpenCV is 
shown with the help of examples. Two major Face recognition algorithms namely
EigenFaces and Fisherfaces are shown.

A bit of benchmarking is done by comparing the machine learning modules of
Shogun to that of OpenCV on a standard dataset. It includes:
1. K-Nearest Neighbours
2. Artificial-Neural-Networks
3. Support Vector Machines

For Python

Both Shogun and OpenCV bind together in numpy arrays, hence the integration
is very lucid. Do checkout the Shogun's ipython notebook section where some of the
vision algorithms are shown using Shogun and OpenCV together. 

Few of them that you should see are:
1. ANPR: Automatic Number Plate Recognition
2. Object classification using SIFT features
3. Sudoku detection
